Analysis of Pokemon stats and battle effectiveness.

Hello world! Using R and Tableau, I have put together an analysis of the Pokemon database thanks to the master list at https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all. 

You can view the markdown of R code I used to manipulate the data to base my visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/views/PokemonStatsandBattleEffectiveness/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link off of. 

This analysis could act as a full battle guide with the capability of showing you any of your Pokemon's strengths, or weaknesses, or if they're above average in their other stats.

Thanks for checking it out!
